## 👋 Hi there, my name is Felix

### I'm a 3rd year student @ UCLA, majoring in Linguistics+CS and minoring in French.

💼 Working at: UCLA DevOps (during the school year)

Some of my hobbies include:
1. Rollerskating 🛼
   My friend took me to the roller rink for the first time in 2021 and I fell 20 times. I've been falling ever since.
2. Weightlifting 🏋🏽
   Not just for health's sake, but I work out to give myself some structure to my daily routine.
3. Learning languages 🌍
   Language is the key to the hearts of others. Being able to speak to someone in their native tongue is one of the most rewarding things in life.

💬 Languages: Python, C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript (React.js), Bash

🛠️ Tools: Visual Studio Code, XCode, Git, Firebase, MongoDB
